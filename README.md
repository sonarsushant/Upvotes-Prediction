# UserUpvotesPrediction

This is a problem statement of [Enigma CodeFest Machine Learning](https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/enigma-codefest-machine-learning/) organized by Analytics Vidhya. In this problem, data of an online community where users answers to the questions asked is provided. We have to predict Upvotes a user will get. The dataset contains 330045 rows and 7 columns.

I have done exploratory danalysis of the dataset followed by training a machine learning model to predict Upvotes.
